    <h2> Mission Statement</h2>
    <p> Women are underrepresented in almost all industries, one of the main ones being the music industry. 
        Women only make 21.7% of all artists, 12.3% of songwriters, and 2.1% of all music producers. 
        In addition, women only made up 10.4% of Grammy nominees for the most popular categories. 
        S.H.E., which stands for “Sing, Hear, Express,” is a non-profit organization located in Los Angeles, California. 
        Our main goal is to provide support to young girls interested in pursuing a career in the music industry. </p>
